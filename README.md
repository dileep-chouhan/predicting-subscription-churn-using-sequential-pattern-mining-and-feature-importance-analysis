# Predicting Subscription Churn using Sequential Pattern Mining and Feature Importance Analysis

**Overview:**

This project analyzes user data from a streaming service to predict subscription churn.  The analysis employs sequential pattern mining techniques to identify common behavioral patterns preceding churn and integrates feature importance analysis to determine the most influential factors contributing to churn.  The goal is to develop a predictive model that allows the service to proactively target at-risk subscribers and implement retention strategies.


**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the analysis:** `python main.py`


**Example Output:**

The script will print key findings to the console, including:

* Summary statistics of the dataset.
* Identified frequent sequential patterns leading to churn.
* Feature importance scores from the predictive model.

Additionally, the script will generate several plot files (located in a designated output directory, e.g., `./output/`) visualizing:

* Key trends in user behavior.
* The distribution of important features.
* (List other generated plots here)
